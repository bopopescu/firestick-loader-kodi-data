ABC iView add-on for Kodi/XBMC
================================

This is a simple ABC iView add-on for Kodi/XBMC that allows you to stream
iView programs.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can use Smart DNS/Proxies
like Unblock-US, UnoTelly or GetFlix or your own VPN solution which
uses an Australian endpoint.

This add-on wouldn't be possible without the great work on 
[python-iview by Jeremy Visser][python_iview].

Installation
------------
First step is the grab the [repo ZIP file][download].

Simply download the ZIP file to your XBMC/Kodi device and install through the menu via:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file.

The Kodi wiki has a good [walk-through guide to installing ZIP files][installzip] if you get stuck.

Once the repository ZIP file is installed, you can install the individual add-ons through the XBMC/Kodi Add-on manager:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Catch-Up TV AU -> Select the add-on category -> Select the add-on -> Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager][addonmanager].

Issues
------
